# `MilestoneBlock`

MilestoneBlock is a blockchain-powered platform designed to track, verify, and incentivize the achievement of personal or collective goals. It creates an immutable record of progress, fostering accountability and motivation through transparent, verifiable milestones.

🏠 Home Screen
The Home screen shows the current list of milestones. When no goals are set, users are prompted to begin their journey.

"There are no milestones to display" — a clean slate, ready to be filled with progress.

🙍‍♀️ Profile Screen
Each user has a Profile page showing their completed and active milestones, reputation, and achievement history — all backed by on-chain proof.

✍️ Create Milestone
With an intuitive form, users can define a new goal: title, description, due date, and reward logic (e.g., NFTs, tokens, badges). Once created, the goal becomes a verifiable entry recorded on the blockchain

# Get started
To get started, you might want to explore the project directory structure and the default configuration file. Working with this project in your development environment will not affect any production deployment or identity tokens.

To learn more before you start working with `MilestoneBlock`, see the following documentation available online:

- [Quick Start](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/deploy-locally)
- [SDK Developer Tools](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install)
- [Motoko Programming Language Guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/motoko)
- [Motoko Language Quick Reference](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/language-manual)

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd MilestoneBlock/
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
